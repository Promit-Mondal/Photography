<p align="justify"><font size="5"><i>Aperture priority, often abbreviated A or Av(for aperture value) on a camera mode dial, is a setting on some cameras that allows the user to set a specific aperture value (f-number) while the camera selects a shutter speed to match it that will result in proper exposure based on the lighting conditions as measured by the camera's light meter. This is different from manual mode, where the user must decide both values, shutter prioritywhere the user picks a shutter speed with the camera selecting an appropriate aperture, or program mode where the camera selects both.</i></font></p>
<li><h2><b><i><u>Shutter Priority Mode:-</u></i></b></h2>
<p align="justify"><font size="5"><i>Shutter priority refers to a setting on some cameras that allows the user to choose a specific shutter speed while the camera adjusts the aperture to ensure correct exposure.

<li><h2><b><i><u>Program Mode:-</u></i></b></h2>
<p align="justify"><font size="5"><i>Program AE, also known as 'P Mode' is a shooting mode where the camerasets both the aperture and shutter speed automatically based on subject brightness to achieve the correct exposure.</i></font></p>
