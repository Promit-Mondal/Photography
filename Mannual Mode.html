<h1><i><u>Manual Mode:--</u></i></h1>
<p align="justify"><font size="6">
Manual Mode is a very powerful & complicated mode of
camera.It gives you the ability to control evevrythings like aperture, shutter speed, iso, whitebalance etc.
Below I will say you about some of those things.
</font></p>
<ol type="I">
 <li><h2><i><u>Aperture:-</u></i></h2>
   <p align="justify"><font size="5">Aperture means a hole which is made by small metal plates.
   Through this hole light comes to camera sensor and makes the picture.This is a very important subject of manual mode.
   Aperture is denoted by f/ like f/8,f/4.8.If f no is small then aperture will be big and it will create shallow depth of field.
   If f no is big then aperture will be small and it create high depth of field.Here, f/8 will create high depth of field and f/4.8
   will create less depth of field.To focus near object use big aperture and to focus rear object use small aperture.
  </font></p>
 <li><h2><i><u>Shutter Speed:-</u></i></h2>
   <p align="justify"><font size="5">
   Shutter speed means the lenth of time when a film or digital sensor of a camera is exposed to light.
   The lenth of time when the shutter of a camera is opened for taking a photo.We control shutter speed
   to take various types of pictures.If you increase shutter speed it will freeze moving object in photo but
   less light will come to camera sensor and the image will be darker.We use low shutter speed for taking images 
   at low light condition and more light will come to camera sensor and the picture will be bright and good.</font></p>
 <li><h2><i><u>Iso:-</u></i></h2>
   <p align="justify"><font size="5">Iso means the sensivity to light of either film or camera sensor.
   A lower iso means less sensivity to light,it gives a dark picture but the picture will be less noisy.
   A higher iso means more sensivity to light,it gives a bright picture but the picture will be more noisy.
     </font></p>
 <li><h2><i><u>Whitebalance:-</u></i></h2>
   <p align="justify"><font size="5">We use many types of white balance to balance colour according to the 
   light of nature or outside.Like you are under the bulb then use bulb whitebalance.Using right Whitebalance
   ,you can capture any object in any lighting situation with it's own natural colour.You can also use another 
   whitebalance to create a artistic photo.</font></p>
 <li><h2><i><u>Metering:-</u></i></h2>
   <p align="justify"><font size="5">In photography, the metering mode refers to the way in which a camera determines exposure.
    Cameras generally allow the user to select between spot, center-weighted average, or multi-zone metering modes.
     In multi -zone metering camera samely expose over all of the picture.In center-weighted average metering camera 
     more expose the center of the picture than other area.In spot metering camera expose only over where you focus.
    </font></p>
 <li><h2><i><u>Focus Type:-</u></i></h2>
   <p align="justify"><font size="5">There are three types of focus.Autofocus mode,One-shot focus,Continuos focus.
   In Autofocus mode the camera will focus autometically.One-shot focus mode is for just focus and shot and in continuos
   focus mode camera will focus on the object continuosly.</font></p>
